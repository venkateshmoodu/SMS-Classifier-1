# SMS-Classifier-1
Develop a text classification model to classify SMS as either spam or non-spam using data science techniques in Python.
Titanic Classification Problem:
1. Dataset Description:
The Titanic dataset typically includes the following columns:

Survived: Binary variable indicating whether a passenger survived (1) or not (0).
Pclass: Ticket class (1st, 2nd, or 3rd).
Name: Passenger's name.
Sex: Gender of the passenger.
Age: Age of the passenger.
SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard.
Parch: Number of parents/children aboard.
Ticket: Ticket number.
Fare: Passenger fare.
Cabin: Cabin number.
Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton).
2. Problem Statement:
The goal is to build a predictive model that can accurately predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on the given features.

3. Data Exploration and Analysis:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing the dataset to understand its structure and relationships between variables.
Handling Missing Data: Dealing with missing values in columns like Age, Cabin, and Embarked.
Visualization: Creating visualizations (e.g., histograms, heatmaps) to identify patterns and correlations in the data.
4. Data Preprocessing:
Feature Engineering: Creating new features from existing ones, such as extracting titles from names or grouping age ranges.
Categorical Variable Encoding: Converting categorical variables (e.g., Sex, Embarked) into numerical format using techniques like one-hot encoding.
Handling Outliers: Identifying and addressing outliers that might affect the model's performance.
5. Model Building:
Train-Test Split: Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
Model Selection: Choosing a suitable classification algorithm (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.).
Model Training: Training the selected model using the training data.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tuning the model's hyperparameters for optimal performance.
6. Model Evaluation:
Performance Metrics: Evaluating the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and the confusion matrix.
Cross-Validation: Ensuring the model's generalizability through techniques like k-fold cross-validation.
7. Model Interpretation:
Feature Importance: Understanding which features contribute the most to the model's predictions.
Visualization: Creating visualizations to interpret and communicate the model's insights.
8. Deployment:
Integration: Integrating the model into a production environment if applicable.
Monitoring: Setting up monitoring mechanisms to track the model's performance over time.
9. Conclusion:
Summarizing the findings, limitations, and recommendations based on the analysis and modeling process.

The Titanic classification problem serves as an excellent introduction to the end-to-end data science workflow, from data exploration to model deployment. It helps practitioners develop essential skills in data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation.
